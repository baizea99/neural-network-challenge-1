The system uses content-based filtering to match loan options with students' attributes, including their financial status, educational background, and personal preferences.

## Features

- **Personalized Loan Recommendations**: Recommends loans based on students' demographic information, educational background, financial status, and employment status.
- **Data Privacy and Security**: Ensures the protection of sensitive personal and financial information.
- **Fairness and Bias Mitigation**: Aims to provide unbiased recommendations by considering diverse and representative data.
